Challenges:

Working as a Team with people who we did not know before the start of this semester, fixing times and having our meetings was also a challenge.
Learning languages which are widely used in the industry like ReactJS & Laravel to which our prior exposure was very limited.
Hosting an entire functioning website on cloud services.
Understanding the Requirements took a lot of discussion and Brain Storming.
Designing the Optimum Layout took multiple Iterations.
To make our website work with various browsers and devices, we have a Responsive Design, doing this was quite a challenge for every Page.
Integrating each others work in one single final Project was also a very interesting new challenge for us.
